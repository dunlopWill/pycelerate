"""pycelerate -- build Excel formulas with Python operators.

Cell references are objects, so Python's own operators assemble the formula and a
precedence-aware renderer parenthesises it correctly::

    from pycelerate import cell, rng, Ref, F

    rev, cost = cell("B3"), cell("B4")
    ws["B5"] = rev - cost                 # =B3-B4
    ws["B6"] = (rev - cost) / rev         # =(B3-B4)/B3
    ws["B7"] = rng("B3:B10").sum() * 1.2  # =SUM(B3:B10)*1.2

Or let ``Sheet`` hand you the reference as you write, so no coordinate is typed
twice::

    s = Sheet(ws)
    rev, cost = s.put("B2", 1000), s.put("B3", 600)
    s.put("B4", (rev - cost) / rev)       # =(B2-B3)/B2

Expressions are ``str`` subclasses whose value is the finished formula, so they can
be assigned straight to an openpyxl cell.  Nothing here imports openpyxl.
